Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any text editor or IDE to write and edit the Python script. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Atom, Sublime Text, or Notepad++. Select the one you're most comfortable with or prefer.

Terminal or Command Prompt: Once you have Python installed, you can open a terminal (Linux or macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) to run the script. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the script file and execute it by typing python script_name.py, replacing script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script.
